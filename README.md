# Fake News Classification

## Abstract
With the popularization of digital media, news has become readily available to human at a click of finger. This development drastically increased our access to information, information that are non-discriminatory in nature. The multitude of sources that are more often than not contradictory has created new challenges for human - choosing what we should believe in. In this project, we explore machine learning approaches to tackle this problem. Using news that have been flagged by human as either fake or real as training dataset, we design classification models that can identify the legitimacy of a news article given its content. Specifically, we apply natural language processing techniques for text feature extraction, and consequently classification models for fake news detection. Our best-performing model reaches prediction accuracy of over 99\%. We understand that our estimate for prediction performance might be limited to the scope of our data sources, and we welcome suggestions and applications built upon our models. 

## Data
We use the **[Fake and real news dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset?select=Fake.csv)** from Kaggle.
